# Solidity Types

## Sized Types
- Purescript does not as of yet have type level naturals
- Luckily we don't need infinitely many
- `Network.Ethereum.Web3.Solidity.Size`
- `D0` ... `D9` and `(:&) :: Type -> Type -> Type`
- `Z :: Type`, `S :: Type -> Type`
- `class KnownSize s`, `class KnownNat n`
- `class KnownSize n <= ByteSize n`
- `class KnownSize n <= IntSize n`

---

### Sized Ints

```haskell
newtype UIntN n = UIntN BigNumber

uIntNFromBigNumber :: 
  forall n . 
     KnownSize n 
  => BigNumber 
  -> Maybe (UIntN n)

type UInt = UIntN (D2 :& D5 :& D6)
```

---

### Vectors

- Purescript makes it pretty easy to implement length indexed vectors

```haskell
newtype Vector n a = Vector (Array a)

nilVector :: forall a . Vector Z a
nilVector = Vector mempty

vCons :: 
  forall a n . 
     a 
  -> Vector n a 
  -> Vector (S n) a
vCons a (Vector as) = Vector (a : as)

toVector :: 
  forall a n . 
     KnownNat n 
  => Array a 
  -> Maybe (Vector n a)

```

---

### Tuples

- The EVM is a stack based virtual machine with a maximum depth of 16. Not very impressive, but limits the possible tuple sizes.

```haskell

data Tuple0 = Tuple0

newtype Tuple1 a = Tuple1 a

...

data Tuple16 a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p = 
  Tuple16 a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p

```
- First iteration of `purescript-web3` didn't handle these well.

---

## Basic (De)Serialization
- All basic Solidity types implement the following type classes for the ABI encoding schema.

```haskell
class ABIEncode a where
  toDataBuilder :: a -> HexString

class ABIDecode a where
  fromDataParser :: Parser String a
```

```haskell
instance abiEncodeUint :: IntSize n => ABIEncode (UIntN n) where
  toDataBuilder a = uInt256HexBuilder <<< unUIntN $ a

instance abiDecodeUint :: IntSize n => ABIDecode (UIntN n) where
  fromDataParser = do
    a <- uInt256HexParser
    maybe (fail $ msg a) pure <<< uIntNFromBigNumber $ a
    where
      msg n = let size = sizeVal (Proxy :: Proxy n)
              in "Couldn't parse as uint" <> show size <> " : " <> show n

```

---

## Tuples
- All Solidity functions accept and return tuples
- Events are emitted as tuples, though not as straight forward to handle
- Encoding and Decoding implemented "generically"

---
## Generics Primer (Advanced)
- All "basic" purescript types (i.e. of kind `Type`) admit a generic decomposition
```haskell
data Argument a = Argument a
data Product a b = Product a b
data Constructor (s :: Symbol) a = Constructor a

from (Tuple3 Bool String (UInt D8)) ::
  Constructor "Tuple3" (Product (Argument Bool) (Product (Argument String) (Argument UInt D8))) 

```
- Compiler implements generic decompositions for us, so we can use them for free.
- We can inductively build up generic types to have a certain property, such as `ABIEncode`
```haskell
instance genericEncodeBase :: ABIEncode a => GenericABIEncode (Argument a)
instance genericEncodeInductive :: (ABIEncode a, GenericABIEncode b) => GenericABIEncode (Product (Argument a) b)
```
---

## Generics

- enables extremely local reasoning, building up more complicated expressions from smaller ones whose correctness is easier to prove.
- "generics" code is extremely reusable.

```haskell
genericEncode ::
  forall a rep .
     Generic a rep
  => GenericABIEncode rep
  => a
  -> HexString
genericABIEncode = genericToDataBuilder <<< from

```
---

## Web3 API

- The Web3 API is a set of RPC methods that the ethereum client knows about
- There are a lot, the type signatures can serve as a sort of documentation

```haskell
eth_sendTransaction :: 
  forall p e . 
     IsAsyncProvider p 
  => TransactionOptions 
  -> Web3 p e HexString

eth_newFilter ::
  forall p e . 
     IsAsyncProvider p 
  => Filter 
  -> Web3 p e FilterId


eth_getFilterChanges :: 
  forall p e . 
     IsAsyncProvider p 
  => FilterId 
  -> Web3 p e (Array Change)

...

```

---

## Web3 API

- Implementation of the client portion heavily inspired by the hs-web3 implementation.
- How easy is it to add new endpoints as they are released?
```haskell
eth_sendTransaction :: forall p e . IsAsyncProvider p => TransactionOptions -> Web3 p e HexString
eth_sendTransaction opts = unsafeCoerceWeb3 $ remote "eth_sendTransaction" opts :: Web3 p () HexString
```
- Pretty easy!

---
## User Interface

You will be able to use `purescript-web3` without knowing how it works. This means:
 
 1. Calling contract methods, listening for events, querying blockchain metadata, full web3 api implementation.
 2. Interacting with metamask.
 3. Easily generate a small client library for every contract.

---

## Generator -- Simple Storage

Simple Storage allows us to change a `uint256`, query that state, and listen for updates to that state.

```solidity
contract SimpleStorage {
    uint public count;

    event CountSet(uint _count);

    function setCount(uint _count) {
        count = _count;
        CountSet(_count);
    }
}

```
---
## Generator -- Simple Storage

Here is the client library generated which is generated from the ABI [^1]

```haskell
count ::
  forall e p . 
     IsAsyncProvider p 
  => Address 
  -> Maybe Address 
  -> CallMode 
  -> Web3 p e (UIntN (D2 :& D5 :& D6))

setCount :: 
  forall e p . 
     IsAsyncProvider p 
  => Maybe Address 
  -> Address 
  -> UIntN (D2 :& D5 :& D6) 
  -> Web3 p e HexString

newtype CountSet = 
  CountSet { _count :: UIntN (D2 :& D5 :& D6) }

```
[^1]: There are a few other boiler plate type declarations, but this is pretty much it.

--- 

## Generator -- Benefits

1. Reduce boiler plate.
2. You don't want to access the raw encoders/decoders manually when templating your transactions, laborious and potentially error prone.
3. The generator is meant to be run as an npm build step -- any breaking changes to your contracts will cause compile time errors in your application. 
4. Specially generated types allow for higher levels of abstraction in library.

---

## Generator -- How does it work

As an example, take a function call that generates a transaction:

```haskell
type SetCountFn = Tagged (SProxy "setCount(uint256)") (Tuple1 (UIntN (D2 :& D5 :& D6)))

setCount :: 
  forall e p . 
     IsAsyncProvider p 
  => Maybe Address 
  -> Address 
  -> UIntN (D2 :& D5 :& D6) 
  -> Web3 p e HexString
setCount x0 x1 x2 = sendTx x0 x1 noPay ((tagged $ Tuple1 x2) :: SetCountFn)


```

Notice the `noPay`

---

## Generator -- How does it work
All templated transaction functions are run with the `sendTx` method:

```haskell
class TxMethod (selector :: Symbol) a where
    sendTx :: forall p e u.
              IsAsyncProvider p
           => IsSymbol selector
           => EtherUnit u
           => Maybe Address
           -- ^ Contract address
           -> Address
           -- ^ from address
           -> u
           -- ^ paymentValue in some denomination
           -> Tagged (SProxy selector) a
           -- ^ Method data
           -> Web3 p e HexString
           -- ^ 'Web3' wrapped tx hash
```

---

## Generator -- Events

 - Events were difficult to find a good solution for due to the Ethereum log structure.
 - All events can be handled with the `event` method, which similarly defined in `hs-web3`

```haskell
event :: forall p e a i ni.
          IsAsyncProvider p
       => DecodeEvent i ni a
       => EventFilter a
       => Address
       -> (a -> ReaderT Change (Web3 p e) EventAction)
       -> Web3 p e (Fiber (eth :: ETH | e) Unit)

```
- this looks more complicated than it is.

---

## Events -- Example

- Here's an example of the event monitor in the example app. It registers a handler and asynchronously polls a filter for the `CountSet` event, updating the React component's state.

- Since the return value of the handler is always `ContinueEvent`, this poll never terminates. 

```haskell
monitorCount :: R.ComponentDidMount CountStateProps CountState (eth :: ETH | eff)
monitorCount this = void $ do
  props <- R.getProps this
  launchAff do
    void $ runWeb3 metamask $
      event config.simpleStorageAddress $ \(SimpleStorage.CountSet cs) -> do
      _ <- liftEff <<< R.transformState this $ _{currentCount= show cs._count}
      pure ContinueEvent
```
